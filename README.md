# Retro scripts

The scripts inside this repository is purely script I once had use for, that also could be useful to the public, to ease the process of improving your hotel.

More scripts will potentially be added in the future.


**Catalog page sorter**:

The catalog page sorter script, will sort your catalog in alphabtical order, while allowing you to specify what pages to exclude from the sorting.

To run the script, simply download or clone the file, edit the database credentials to match your database, once the database credentials has been setup, you open your CMD (Command prompt) browse into the folder your file is stored at and then run ``php catalog-page-sorter.php``. The script will then run and let you know once it's finished. After finishing, head into your hotel and do ``:update_catalog``.


**Important**

Make sure to always backup your database before running scripts, in-case something unforseen happens.
